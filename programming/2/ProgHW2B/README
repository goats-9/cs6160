Meet-in-the-Middle AES Attack
-----------------------------

The attached source codes demonstrate the use of the libgcrypt library in C++ in
implementing a meet-in-the-middle 2-AES attack. To run the code, open a terminal
window, cd to this directory, and compile the source code using the command

    g++ 2aes16bitDecryption.cpp -lgcrypt

and run it by simply typing

    ./a.out

in the same terminal window. The secret plaintext should be output at the end of
the program.
